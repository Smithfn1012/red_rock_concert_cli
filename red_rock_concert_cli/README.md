# RedRockConcertCli

Welcome to your new RedRockConcertCli gem! This gem will allow you to access information regarding upcoming concerts at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado! This is a beautiful outdoor venue that is over 6,500 ft. above sea-level, holds a little more than 9,500 people, and has been host to some of the most loved and treasured artists! Please enjoy the cli gem that I created for a final project as a student at FlatIron School.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'red_rock_concert_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install red_rock_concert_cli

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
